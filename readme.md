# P2EPro Coding Challenges

This repository houses the coding challenges for P2EPro. These are small hands-on projects that are very relevant to the tasks you will be working on.

### Ground Rules

- We prefer well-thought-out solutions over the quick-and-dirty kind. So take your time, if you need it

### What we look for

We do recognize and value the time and effort applicants put into their submission. Our Coding Challenges reflect some of the tasks and skills you'd need while working with us.

Rather than a complex solution, which added a million features and added 1000's of lines of code, we look for:

- **Clarity:** You can write clear code that any devs could read and understand in one go
- **Simplicity:** You can write gimmick-free and straightforward code with no ambiguities
- **Defensiveness:** You can cover edge cases and treat user inputs with care
- **Resilience:** You can gracefully handling an error and unexpected behaviour

### What happens after your submission

Once you have submitted your solution by sending us the github repository, our Engineers will review the code. Based on the feedback, we will invite you for a meeting to talk more about your submission and continue the recruitment process.

## Challenge

- Create a simple reading list app based on the following UI
- [User interface](https://i.imgur.com/QQMF3G9.png)
- Frontend needs to be built on React
- Needs a backend API based on ExpressJS to persist data
- No need for a database layer like Mysql or MongoDB but a simple [local JSON database](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lowdb) would suffice
- Note that we require you to add **full unit tests coverage and that all tests pass**

## Features required

- Add a new book to the reading list
- Render the list
- Remove a book from the list

### Have fun, and we look forward to your submission!
